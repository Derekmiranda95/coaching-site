## 🔍 **Did You Upload Both Files?**

Since you tested it, please confirm:

1. **Did you upload index.html to GitHub?** (366 lines)
2. **Did you upload js/main.js to GitHub?** (365 lines with webhook on line 96)
3. **Did you wait 2 minutes for Cloudflare deployment?**

If you haven't uploaded yet, that's why the test didn't work - the old files are still on your live site.

## ✅ **Next Steps:**

1. Upload **index.html** (366 lines total)
2. Upload **js/main.js** (365 lines total, webhook on line 96)
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Test again at www.freebodyperformance.com

**The webhook IS in the file - line 96 of js/main.js. But you need to upload it to GitHub first!**
