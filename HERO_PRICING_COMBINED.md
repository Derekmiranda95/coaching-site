## 📱 MOBILE OPTIMIZATION

### **Responsive Breakpoints:**

**Desktop (1200px+):**
- Full hero height
- Pricing card: 600px wide
- All text fully visible
- Button prominent

**Tablet (768px-1199px):**
- Slightly reduced padding
- Pricing card: ~90% width
- Text scales appropriately

## 🔥 BUTTON CHANGE: "Purchase Now"

- Could mean sign-up, consultation, info
- Lower commitment signal

**"Purchase Now":**
- ✅ Clear action (buying)
- ✅ Direct language
- ✅ Higher commitment signal
- ✅ Qualifies serious buyers
- ✅ E-commerce standard

**Impact:**
- Slightly lower click rate
- But MUCH higher conversion rate
- Quality over quantity of clicks
